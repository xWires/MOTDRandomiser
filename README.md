# MOTDRandomiser

MOTDRandomiser is a plugin that makes it so the MOTD of your Bukkit/Spigot/Paper/BungeeCord/Velocity server is randomised every time a user presses "Refresh" in the server list. (Plus, you don't have to restart your server to update the MOTD list!)

You can download it from Modrinth [here](https://modrinth.com/project/motdrandomiser).
